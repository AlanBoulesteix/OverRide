# OverRide Project - 42
This project aims to further your knowledge in the world of elf-like binary exploitation in i386 system.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to progress through the levels by identifying vulnerabilities in the provided executables and exploiting these weaknesses to retrieve the "flags" hidden in each level.

## Project Structure
Each level consists of an executable with specific vulnerabilities.
Students must identify and exploit these vulnerabilities to retrieve the password or secret key (flag).
Some levels may require knowledge in scripting, reverse engineering, or exploiting security vulnerabilities.

## Instructions
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory of the desired level.
Analyze the source code, identify vulnerabilities, and exploit them.
Retrieve the flag and progress to the next level.
